# Perceptrons

This repository solves the excerices on ```TP3-2020-2do-Cuat.pdf``` by implementing the following perceptrons and training them on different sets of data:

- Simple perceptron (**sign** activation function)
- Simple non-linear perceptron (**tanh** and **sigmoid** activation functions)
- Multi-layer perceptron (1 hidden layer with 6 neurons, 1 output neuron, **tanh** and **signoid** activation functions)

# Running the excercises

You must have Python and Numpy installed (run ```pip install numpy``` to install it)
1) Run ```python excercises.py```
